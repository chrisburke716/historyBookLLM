    "**Goal**: Extract entities and relationships from historical text, normalize them, and visualize as a knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: Hybrid normalization pipeline\n",
    "1. **LLM Extraction** - GPT structured outputs to extract entities + relationships per paragraph\n",
    "2. **ID Assignment** - UUIDs with bidirectional entity↔relationship links\n",
    "3. **Rule-Based Normalization** - Exact name + alias matching to collapse obvious duplicates\n",
    "4. **Embedding Similarity** - Compute on rule-normalized entities (not raw) to find remaining merge candidates\n",
    "5. **LLM Merge (incremental)** - Evaluate candidates in order of similarity, merge as we go to avoid redundant comparisons\n",
    "6. **Graph Construction & Visualization** - NetworkX + PyVis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Running LLM normalization on all raw entity pairs is an N² problem that doesn't scale. The hybrid approach reduces this dramatically:\n",
    "- Rule-based pass collapses ~30-40% of entities (exact name + alias matches)\n",
    "- Embedding similarity on the reduced set finds only the ambiguous candidates\n",
    "- Incremental LLM merge skips pairs already in the same group"
