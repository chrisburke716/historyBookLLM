6,321,Etruscan,Etruscans,0.8888888888888888,True,0.9,Both entries clearly refer to the same historical group: the Etruscan people/culture. One entry names the culture (Etruscan) and the other names the people (Etruscans) with detailed attributes; these are not distinct entities but two forms of the same entity (culture/people).
6,321,Etruscans,Etruria,0.625,False,0.85,"The first is a people (Etruscans); the second is a region (Etruria) where that people lived. They are related but distinct types (collective people vs geographic region), so they should not be merged."
7,321,Greece,Greek,0.6666666666666667,False,0.92,"The two entities are related but not identical. 'Greece' is a geographic region, while 'Greek' refers to the culture/language/people associated with that region. The description for 'Greek' (culture from which the Etruscan alphabet was derived) describes a cultural/linguistic entity rather than the place itself.

The descriptions indicate different timeframes and political forms, so they should not be merged."
7,321,Romans,Rome,0.5,False,0.85,"Entity 1 (Romans) denotes the people/citizens of Rome/the Roman state. Entity 2 (Rome) denotes the city/place. They are related but not identical: one is a population/collective people, the other is a geographic/political place.

""early republic"" denotes the early period of the Roman Republic but is not a distinct entity separate from the Roman Republic as a political collective; they are the same state entity (one is a temporal subset)."
13,323,Roman census,Roman People,0.5833333333333333,False,0.82,The two entities are different types and concepts: one is an event/procedure (the Roman census) used to register/classify citizens; the other is the collective people of Rome (the Roman People) who exercised sovereignty.
