Virtually all the physical and much of\\nthe mental formation we still take for granted was by then\\ndetermined, ɹxed in the sense that some possibilities were excluded\\nand others were not. The crucial process is the evolution of human\\ncreatures as a distinct branch among the primates, for it is at this\\nfork in the line, as it were, that we begin to look out for the station\\nat which we get oʃ for History.

Changes recorded in\\nfossils of ɻora and fauna, in geographical forms and geological\\nstrata, narrate a drama of epic scale lasting hundreds of millions of\\nyears. During them the shape of the world changed out of\\nrecognition many times. Great rifts opened and closed in its\\nsurface, coasts rose and fell; at times huge areas were covered with\\na long-since vanished vegetation. Many species of plants and\\nanimals emerged and proliferated. Most died out.

      "draw to a close. It had favoured the great reptiles and during it\n",
      "Antarctica had separated from Australia. There were no ice-ɹelds\n",

      "in sequence and accidents of selection on the way, these strains\n",
      "were themselves to evolve into the mammals which occupy our\n",

      "Crudely summarized, the main lines of this evolution were\n",
      "probably determined for millions of years mainly by astronomical\n",
      "cycles and a few sudden events, such as eruption of massive\n",
      "volcanoes or the impact of asteroids. Climate was the all-important\n",
      "factor, changed by the earth’s position in relation to the sun or by\n",
      "short-term circumstances. A huge pattern emerges, of recurrent\n",
      "swings of temperature. The extremes which resulted, of climatic\n",
      "cooling on the one hand and aridity on the other, choked oʃ some\n",
      "possible lines of development. Conversely, in other times, and in\n",
      "certain places, the onset of appropriately benign conditions\n",
      "allowed certain species to ɻourish and encouraged their spread\n",
      "into new habitats. The only major sub-division of this immensely\n",
      "long process which concerns us comes very recently (in prehistoric\n",
      "terms), slightly less than 4 million years ago. There then began a\n",
      "period of climatic changes which we believe to have been more\n",
      "rapid and violent than most observed in earlier times. ‘Rapid’, we\n",
      "must again remind ourselves, is a comparative term; these changes\n",
      "took tens of thousands of years. Such a pace of change, though,\n",
      "looks very diʃerent from the millions of years of much steadier\n",
      "conditions which lay in the past.\n",
      "Scholars have long talked about ‘Ice Ages’, each lasting between\n",
      "50,000 and 100,000 years, which covered big areas of the northern\n",
      "hemisphere (including much of Europe, and America as far south\n",

      "The Ice Ages make it easy to see how climate determined life and\n",
      "its evolution in prehistoric times, but to emphasize their dramatic\n",
      "direct eʃects is misleading. No doubt the slow onset of the ice was\n",
      "decisive and often disastrous for what lay in its path. Many of us\n",
      "still live in landscapes shaped by its scouring and gouging\n",
      "thousands of centuries ago. The huge inundations which followed\n",
      "the retreat of the ice as it melted must also have been locally\n",
      "catastrophic, destroying the habitats of creatures which had\n",
      "adapted to the challenge of arctic conditions. Yet they also created\n",
      "new opportunities. After each glaciation, new species spread into\n",
      "the areas uncovered by the thaw. Beyond regions directly aʃected,\n",
      "though, the eʃects of the glaciations may have been even more\n",
      "important for the global story of evolution. Changes in\n",
      "environment followed cooling and warming thousands of miles\n",
      "from the ice itself; and the outcome had its own determining force.\n",
      "Both aridiɹcation and the spread of grassland, for instance,\n",
      "changed the possibilities of species spreading themselves into new\n",
      "areas, especially if they could stand upright and move on two feet.\n",
      "Some of those species form part of the human evolutionary story,\n",
      "and all the most important stages in that evolution – so far\n",
      "observed – have been located in Africa, far from the ice-ɹelds.\n",
      "Climate can still be very important today, as contemplation of\n",
      "the disasters caused by drought show. But such eʃects, even when\n",
      "they aʃect millions of people, are not so fundamental as the slow\n",
      "transformation of the basic geography of the world and its supplies\n",
      "of food which climate wrought in prehistoric times. Until very\n",

      "environments available to branches of the human family fortunate\n",
      "enough to possess such skills, or able to discover and learn them.\n",
      "Diʃerent food-gathering possibilities in diʃerent habitats meant\n",
      "diʃerent chances of a varied diet and, eventually, of progressing\n",
      "from gathering to hunting, and then to growing. Long before the\n",
      "Ice Ages, though, and even before the appearance of the creatures\n",
      "from which humanity was to evolve, climate was setting the stage\n",
      "for and thus shaping, by selection, the eventual genetic inheritance\n",
      "of humanity itself.\n",
      "One more backward glance is useful before plunging into the\n",
      "still shallow (though gradually deepening) pool of evidence. One\n",
      "hundred million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two\n",
      "main sorts. Some, rodent-like, remained on the ground; others took\n",
      "or had taken to the trees. In this way the competition for resources\n",
      "was lessened and strains of each survived to people the world with\n",
      "the creatures we know today. In the second group were the\n",
      "prosimians. We are among their descendants, for they were the\n",
      "ancestors of the ɹrst primates.\n",
      "It is best not to be too impressed by talk about ‘ancestors’ in any\n",
      "but the most general sense. Between the prosimians and ourselves\n",
      "lie millions of generations and many evolutionary blind alleys. It is\n",
      "important none the less that our remotest identiɹable ancestors\n",
      "lived in trees because what survived in the next phase of evolution\n",
      "were genetic strains best suited to the special uncertainties and\n",
      "accidental challenges of the forest. That environment put a\n",
      "premium on the capacity to learn. Those survived whose genetic\n",
      "inheritance could respond and adapt to the surprising, sudden\n",
      "danger of deep shade, confused visual patterns and treacherous\n",
      "handholds. Strains prone to accident in such conditions were wiped\n",
      "out. Among those that prospered (genetically speaking) were some\n",
      "species with long digits which were to develop into ɹngers and,\n",
      "eventually, the oppositional thumb, and other forerunners of the\n",
      "apes already embarked upon an evolution towards three-\n",
      "dimensional vision and the diminution of the importance of the\n",
      "sense of smell.\n",
      "The prosimians were little creatures. Tree-shrews still exist which\n",
      "give us some idea of what they were like; they were far from being\n",
      "monkeys, let alone men. Yet for millions of years they carried the\n",
      "traits which made humanity possible. During this time geography\n",
      "counted for much in their evolution, by imposing limits on contact\n",
      "between diʃerent strains, sometimes eʃectively isolating them,\n",
      "and thus increasing diʃerentiation.\n",
      "Changes would not happen quickly but it is likely that\n",
      "fragmentations of the environment caused by geographical\n",
      "disturbance led to the isolation of zones in which, little by little,\n",
      "the recognizable ancestors of many modern mammals appeared.\n",
      "Among them are the ɹrst monkeys and apes. They do not seem to\n",
      "go back more than 60 million years or so.\n",
      "These monkeys and apes represent a great evolutionary stride.\n",
      "Both families had much greater manipulative dexterity than any\n",
      "predecessor. Within them, species distinct in size or acrobatic\n",
      "quality began to evolve. Physiological and psychological evolution\n",
      "blur in such matters. Like the development of better and\n",
      "stereoscopic vision, the growth of manipulative power seems to\n",
      "imply a growth of consciousness. Perhaps some of these creatures\n",
      "could distinguish diʃerent colours. The brains of the ɹrst primates\n",
      "were already much more complex than those of any of their\n",
      "predecessors; they were bigger, too. Somewhere the brain of one or\n",
      "more of these strains became complex enough and its physical\n",
      "powers suɽciently developed for the animal to cross the line at\n",
      "which the world as a mass of undiʃerentiated sensations becomes\n",
      "at least in part a world of objects. Whenever this happened it was\n",
      "a decisive step towards mastering the world by using it, instead of\n",
      "reacting automatically to it.\n",
      "Some 25 or 30 million years ago, as desiccation began to reduce\n",
      "the area of the forests, competition for diminishing forest resources\n",
      "became ɹercer. Environmental challenge and opportunity\n",
      "appeared where the trees and the grasslands met. Some primates,\n",
      "not powerful enough to hold on to their forest homes, were able,\n",
      "because of some genetic quality, to penetrate the savannahs in\n",
      "search of food and could meet the challenge and exploit the\n",
      "opportunities. Probably they had a posture and movement\n",
      "marginally more like that of men than, say, that of the gorillas or\n",
      "chimpanzees. An upright stance and the capacity to move easily on\n",
      "two feet make it possible to carry burdens, among them food. The\n",
      "dangerous open savannah could then be explored and its resources\n",
      "withdrawn from it to a safer home base. Most animals consume\n",
      "their food where they ɹnd it; man does not. Freedom to use the\n",
      "forelimbs for something other than locomotion or ɹghting also\n",
      "suggests other possibilities. We cannot conɹrm what the ɹrst ‘tool’\n",
      "was, but primates other than man have been seen to pick up\n",
      "objects which come to hand and wave them as a deterrent, use\n",
      "them as weapons, or investigate and expose possible sources of\n",
      "food with their aid.\n",
      "The next step in the argument is enormous, for it takes us to the\n",
      "ɹrst glimpse of a member of the biological family to which both\n",
      "man and the great apes belong. The evidence is fragmentary, but\n",
      "suggests that some 15 or 16 million years ago a very successful\n",
      "species was widespread throughout Africa, Europe and Asia.\n",
      "Probably it was a tree-dweller and certainly specimens were not\n",
      "very large – they may have weighed about forty pounds.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the evidence is such as to leave it isolated in time.\n",
      "We have no direct knowledge of its immediate forebears or\n",
      "descendants, but some kind of fork in the road of primate\n",
      "evolution seems to have occurred to its later relatives, often called\n",
      "hominids, around 5 million years ago. While one branch was to\n",
      "lead to the great apes and chimpanzees, the other led to human\n",
      "beings. This line has been named ‘hominin’. It is likely that the\n",
      "separation of these groups was a relatively slow process, occurring\n",
      "over millions of years, with episodes of interbreeding taking place.\n",
      "During that time big geological and geographical changes must\n",
      "have favoured and disfavoured many new evolutionary patterns.\n",
      "The earliest surviving hominin fossils belong to a species which\n",
      "may or may not provide the ancestors for the small hominids\n",
      "which eventually emerged over a wide area of east and south-east\n",
      "Africa after this huge period of upheaval. They belong to the\n",
      "family now called Australopithecus. The earliest fragments of their\n",

      "oldest complete skull and a nearly complete skeleton found near\n",
      "Johannesburg in 1998 are probably at least half-a-million years\n",
      "‘younger’ than that. This is not very diʃerent (allowing for the\n",

      "the passage of time, then Europeans began to settle in the\n",

      "ago, too. Some six or seven hours further back on our scale, and\n",
      "much more remote, we can discern the first recognizable human\n",
      "beings of a modern physiological type already established in\n",
      "western Europe. Behind them, anything from a fortnight to three\n",
      "weeks earlier, appear the first traces of creatures with some human\n",
      "characteristics whose contribution to the evolution which followed\n",
      "is still in debate.\n",

      "considering for a moment even larger tracts of time simply because\n",
      "so much happened in them which, even if we cannot say anything\n",
      "very precise about it, shaped what followed. This is because\n",
      "humanity was to carry forward into historical times certain\n",
      "possibilities and limitations, and they were settled long ago, in a\n",
      "past even more remote than the much shorter period of time – 4½\n",
      "million years or so – in which creatures with at least some claim to\n",
      "human qualities are known to have existed. Though it is not our\n",

      "of time as change-makers. Virtually all the physical and much of\n",
      "the mental formation we still take for granted was by then\n",
      "determined, fixed in the sense that some possibilities were excluded\n",
      "and others were not. The crucial process is the evolution of human\n",
      "creatures as a distinct branch among the primates, for it is at this\n",
      "fork in the line, as it were, that we begin to look out for the station\n",
      "at which we get off for History. It is here that we can hope to find\n",
      "the first signs of that positive, conscious impact upon environment\n",
      "which marks the first stage of human achievement.\n",
      "The bedrock of the story is the earth itself. Changes recorded in\n",
      "fossils of flora and fauna, in geographical forms and geological\n",
      "strata, narrate a drama of epic scale lasting hundreds of millions of\n",
      "years. During them the shape of the world changed out of\n",
      "recognition many times. Great rifts opened and closed in its\n",
      "surface, coasts rose and fell; at times huge areas were covered with\n",

      "three weeks or so of life, could sense the rhythm of the seasons. Yet\n",
      "slowly the earth was taking shape as a collection of habitats\n",
      "permitting different strains to survive. Meanwhile, biological\n",
      "evolution inched forwards with almost inconceivable slowness.\n",
      "Climate was the first great pacemaker of change. About 65\n",
      "million years ago – an early enough point at which to begin to\n",
      "grapple with our story – a long warm climatic phase began to\n",
      "draw to a close. It had favoured the great reptiles and during it\n",
      "Antarctica had separated from Australia. There were no ice-fields\n",
      "then in any part of the globe. As the world grew colder and the\n",
      "new climatic conditions restricted their habitat, the great reptiles\n",
      "did not manage to adapt, though it is likely that it was a sudden\n",
      "event – the impact of a giant asteroid – that killed them off\n",
      "completely. But the new conditions suited other animal strains\n",
      "which were already about, among them some mammals whose tiny\n",
      "ancestors had appeared 200 million years or so earlier. They now\n",
      "inherited the earth, or a considerable part of it. With many breaks\n",
      "in sequence and accidents of selection on the way, these strains\n",
      "were themselves to evolve into the mammals which occupy our\n",
      "own world – ourselves included.\n",
      "Crudely summarized, the main lines of this evolution were\n",
      "probably determined for millions of years mainly by astronomical\n",
      "cycles and a few sudden events, such as eruption of massive\n",
      "volcanoes or the impact of asteroids. Climate was the all-important\n",
      "factor, changed by the earth’s position in relation to the sun or by\n",
      "short-term circumstances. A huge pattern emerges, of recurrent\n",
      "swings of temperature. The extremes which resulted, of climatic\n",
      "cooling on the one hand and aridity on the other, choked off some\n",
      "possible lines of development. Conversely, in other times, and in\n",
      "certain places, the onset of appropriately benign conditions\n",
      "allowed certain species to flourish and encouraged their spread\n",
      "into new habitats. The only major sub-division of this immensely\n",
      "long process which concerns us comes very recently (in prehistoric\n",
      "terms), slightly less than 4 million years ago. There then began a\n",
      "period of climatic changes which we believe to have been more\n",
      "rapid and violent than most observed in earlier times. ‘Rapid’, we\n",
      "must again remind ourselves, is a comparative term; these changes\n",
      "took tens of thousands of years. Such a pace of change, though,\n",
      "looks very different from the millions of years of much steadier\n",
      "conditions which lay in the past.\n",
      "Scholars have long talked about ‘Ice Ages’, each lasting between\n",
      "50,000 and 100,000 years, which covered big areas of the northern\n",
      "hemisphere (including much of Europe, and America as far south\n",
      "as modern New York) with great ice sheets, sometimes a mile or\n",
      "more thick. They have now distinguished some seventeen to\n",
      "nineteen (there is argument about the exact number) such\n",
      "‘glaciations’ since the onset of the first, over 3 million years ago.\n",
      "We live in a warm period following the most recent of them, which\n",
      "came to an end some 10,000 years ago. Evidence of these\n",
      "glaciations and their effects is now available from all oceans and\n",
      "continents and they provide the backbone for prehistoric\n",
      "chronology. To the external scale which the Ice Ages provide we\n",
      "can relate such clues as we have to the evolution of humanity.\n",
      "The Ice Ages make it easy to see how climate determined life and\n",
      "its evolution in prehistoric times, but to emphasize their dramatic\n",
      "direct effects is misleading. No doubt the slow onset of the ice was\n",
      "decisive and often disastrous for what lay in its path. Many of us\n",
      "still live in landscapes shaped by its scouring and gouging\n",
      "thousands of centuries ago. The huge inundations which followed\n",
      "the retreat of the ice as it melted must also have been locally\n",
      "catastrophic, destroying the habitats of creatures which had\n",
      "adapted to the challenge of arctic conditions. Yet they also created\n",
      "new opportunities. After each glaciation, new species spread into\n",
      "the areas uncovered by the thaw. Beyond regions directly affected,\n",
      "though, the effects of the glaciations may have been even more\n",
      "important for the global story of evolution. Changes in\n",
      "environment followed cooling and warming thousands of miles\n",
      "from the ice itself; and the outcome had its own determining force.\n",
      "Both aridification and the spread of grassland, for instance,\n",
      "changed the possibilities of species spreading themselves into new\n",
      "areas, especially if they could stand upright and move on two feet.\n",
      "Some of those species form part of the human evolutionary story,\n",
      "and all the most important stages in that evolution – so far\n",
      "observed – have been located in Africa, far from the ice-fields.\n",
      "Climate can still be very important today, as contemplation of\n",
      "the disasters caused by drought show. But such effects, even when\n",
      "they affect millions of people, are not so fundamental as the slow\n",
      "transformation of the basic geography of the world and its supplies\n",
      "of food which climate wrought in prehistoric times. Until very\n",
      "recently climate determined where and how humans lived. It made\n",
      "technique very important (and still does): the possession in early\n",
      "times of a skill such as fishing or fire-making could make new\n",
      "environments available to branches of the human family fortunate\n",
      "enough to possess such skills, or able to discover and learn them.\n",
      "Different food-gathering possibilities in different habitats meant\n",
      "different chances of a varied diet and, eventually, of progressing\n",
      "from gathering to hunting, and then to growing. Long before the\n",
      "Ice Ages, though, and even before the appearance of the creatures\n",
      "from which humanity was to evolve, climate was setting the stage\n",
      "for and thus shaping, by selection, the eventual genetic inheritance\n",
      "of humanity itself.\n",
      "One more backward glance is useful before plunging into the\n",
      "still shallow (though gradually deepening) pool of evidence. One\n",
      "hundred million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two\n",
      "main sorts. Some, rodent-like, remained on the ground; others took\n",
      "or had taken to the trees. In this way the competition for resources\n",
      "was lessened and strains of each survived to people the world with\n",
      "the creatures we know today. In the second group were the\n",
      "prosimians. We are among their descendants, for they were the\n",
      "ancestors of the first primates.\n",
      "It is best not to be too impressed by talk about ‘ancestors’ in any\n",
      "but the most general sense. Between the prosimians and ourselves\n",
      "lie millions of generations and many evolutionary blind alleys. It is\n",
      "important none the less that our remotest identifiable ancestors\n",
      "lived in trees because what survived in the next phase of evolution\n",
      "were genetic strains best suited to the special uncertainties and\n",
      "accidental challenges of the forest. That environment put a\n",
      "premium on the capacity to learn. Those survived whose genetic\n",
      "inheritance could respond and adapt to the surprising, sudden\n",
      "danger of deep shade, confused visual patterns and treacherous\n",
      "handholds. Strains prone to accident in such conditions were wiped\n",
      "out. Among those that prospered (genetically speaking) were some\n",
      "species with long digits which were to develop into fingers and,\n",
      "eventually, the oppositional thumb, and other forerunners of the\n",
      "apes already embarked upon an evolution towards three-\n",
      "dimensional vision and the diminution of the importance of the\n",
      "sense of smell.\n",
      "The prosimians were little creatures. Tree-shrews still exist which\n",
      "give us some idea of what they were like; they were far from being\n",
      "monkeys, let alone men. Yet for millions of years they carried the\n",
      "traits which made humanity possible. During this time geography\n",
      "counted for much in their evolution, by imposing limits on contact\n",
      "between different strains, sometimes effectively isolating them,\n",
      "and thus increasing differentiation.\n",
      "Changes would not happen quickly but it is likely that\n",
      "fragmentations of the environment caused by geographical\n",
      "disturbance led to the isolation of zones in which, little by little,\n",
      "the recognizable ancestors of many modern mammals appeared.\n",
      "Among them are the first monkeys and apes. They do not seem to\n",
      "go back more than 60 million years or so.\n",
      "These monkeys and apes represent a great evolutionary stride.\n",
      "Both families had much greater manipulative dexterity than any\n",
      "predecessor. Within them, species distinct in size or acrobatic\n",
      "quality began to evolve. Physiological and psychological evolution\n",
      "blur in such matters. Like the development of better and\n",
      "stereoscopic vision, the growth of manipulative power seems to\n",
      "imply a growth of consciousness. Perhaps some of these creatures\n",
      "could distinguish different colours. The brains of the first primates\n",
      "were already much more complex than those of any of their\n",
      "predecessors; they were bigger, too. Somewhere the brain of one or\n",
      "more of these strains became complex enough and its physical\n",
      "powers sufficiently developed for the animal to cross the line at\n",
      "which the world as a mass of undifferentiated sensations becomes\n",
      "at least in part a world of objects. Whenever this happened it was\n",
      "a decisive step towards mastering the world by using it, instead of\n",
      "reacting automatically to it.\n",
      "Some 25 or 30 million years ago, as desiccation began to reduce\n",
      "the area of the forests, competition for diminishing forest resources\n",
      "became fiercer. Environmental challenge and opportunity\n",
      "appeared where the trees and the grasslands met. Some primates,\n",
      "not powerful enough to hold on to their forest homes, were able,\n",
      "because of some genetic quality, to penetrate the savannahs in\n",
      "search of food and could meet the challenge and exploit the\n",
      "opportunities. Probably they had a posture and movement\n",
      "marginally more like that of men than, say, that of the gorillas or\n",
      "chimpanzees. An upright stance and the capacity to move easily on\n",
      "two feet make it possible to carry burdens, among them food. The\n",
      "dangerous open savannah could then be explored and its resources\n",
      "withdrawn from it to a safer home base. Most animals consume\n",
      "their food where they find it; man does not. Freedom to use the\n",
      "forelimbs for something other than locomotion or fighting also\n",
      "suggests other possibilities. We cannot confirm what the first ‘tool’\n",
      "was, but primates other than man have been seen to pick up\n",
      "objects which come to hand and wave them as a deterrent, use\n",
      "them as weapons, or investigate and expose possible sources of\n",
      "food with their aid.\n",
      "The next step in the argument is enormous, for it takes us to the\n",
      "first glimpse of a member of the biological family to which both\n",
      "man and the great apes belong. The evidence is fragmentary, but\n",
      "suggests that some 15 or 16 million years ago a very successful\n",
      "species was widespread throughout Africa, Europe and Asia.\n",
      "Probably it was a tree-dweller and certainly specimens were not\n",
      "very large – they may have weighed about forty pounds.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the evidence is such as to leave it isolated in time.\n",
      "We have no direct knowledge of its immediate forebears or\n",
      "descendants, but some kind of fork in the road of primate\n",
      "evolution seems to have occurred to its later relatives, often called\n",
      "hominids, around 5 million years ago. While one branch was to\n",
      "lead to the great apes and chimpanzees, the other led to human\n",
      "beings. This line has been named ‘hominin’. It is likely that the\n",
      "separation of these groups was a relatively slow process, occurring\n",
      "over millions of years, with episodes of interbreeding taking place.\n",
      "During that time big geological and geographical changes must\n",
      "have favoured and disfavoured many new evolutionary patterns.\n",
      "The earliest surviving hominin fossils belong to a species which\n",
      "may or may not provide the ancestors for the small hominids\n",
      "which eventually emerged over a wide area of east and south-east\n",
      "Africa after this huge period of upheaval. They belong to the\n",
      "family now called Australopithecus. The earliest fragments of their\n",
      "fossils have been identified as over 4 million years old, but the\n",
      "oldest complete skull and a nearly complete skeleton found near\n",
      "Johannesburg in 1998 are probably at least half-a-million years\n",
      "‘younger’ than that. This is not very different (allowing for the\n",
      "generous stretches of time and approximation available in\n",
      "prehistoric chronology) from the dating of ‘Lucy’, formerly the\n",
      "most complete specimen of Australopithecus discovered (in\n",
      "Ethiopia). Evidence of other species of ‘australopithecines’ (as they\n",
      "are usually termed), found as far apart as Kenya and the\n",
      "Transvaal, can be dated to various periods over the next 2 million\n",
      "years and has had a great impact upon archaeological thinking.\n",
      "Since 1970, something like 3 million years has been added to the\n",
      "period in which the search for human origins goes on, thanks to\n",
      "the australopithecine discoveries. Great uncertainty and much\n",
      "debate still surround them, but if the human species have a\n",

      "given. Homo was no doubt related to Australopithecus, but is first\n",
      "clearly identifiable as distinct about 2 million years ago on certain\n",

      "about such fragmentary evidence as we have (all that is left of 2\n",

      "we can be fairly certain about the extent to which some\n",
      "characteristics later observable in humans already existed more\n",
      "than 2 million years ago. We know, for instance, that the\n",

      "bones and feet which were man-like rather than ape-like. We know\n",
      "they walked upright and could run and carry loads for long\n",
      "distances as apes could not. Their hands showed a flattening at the\n",
      "fingertips characteristic of those of men. These are stages far\n",
      "advanced on the road of human physique, even if the actual\n",

      "more profound and skills more complex. About this point the\n",
      "mechanics of what is going forward begin to slip from our grasp\n",

      "the female hominin. We do not know when this happened, but\n",
      "after it had been completed her sexual rhythm was importantly\n",
      "differentiated from that of other animals. Man is the only animal\n",
      "in which the mechanism of the oestrus (the restriction of the\n",

      "in which she is on heat) has entirely disappeared. It is easy to see\n",
      "the evolutionary connection between this and the prolongation of\n",
      "infancy: if female hominins had undergone the violent disruption\n",
      "of their ordinary routine which the oestrus imposes, their offspring\n",
      "would have been periodically exposed to a neglect which would\n",

      "or a million and a half years because it cannot have been effected\n",

      "Such a change has radical implications. The increasing\n",
      "attractiveness and receptivity of females to males make individual\n",
      "choice much more significant in mating. The selection of a partner\n",
      "is less shaped by the rhythm of nature; we are at the start of a very\n",
      "long and obscure road which leads to the idea of sexual love.\n",
      "Together with prolonged infant dependency, the new possibilities\n",
      "of individual selection point ahead also to the stable and enduring\n",
      "family unit of father, mother and offspring, an institution unique\n",
      "to mankind. Some have even speculated that incest taboos (which\n",
      "are in practice well-nigh universal, however much the precise\n",

      "Yet all reflections support the general hypothesis that the changes\n",

      "which humanity was to evolve. He had unprecedented capacity to\n",

      "scale hints strongly at a new level of mental ability, at a\n",
      "conception of the object formed before manufacture is begun, and\n",

      "China, and probably from between 300,000 and 500,000 years\n",
      "ago. But very recent discoveries in the Transvaal have provided\n",
      "evidence, convincing to some scholars, that hominins there were\n",

      "did not for a long time possess this skill. That he knew how to use\n",
      "it, on the other hand, is indisputable. The importance of this\n",
      "knowledge is attested by the folklore of many later peoples; in\n",
      "almost all of them a heroic figure or magical beast first seizes fire.\n",
      "A violation of the supernatural order is implied: in the Greek\n",
      "legend Prometheus steals the fire of the gods. This is suggestive,\n",
      "not solid, but perhaps the first fire was taken from outbreaks of\n",
      "natural gas or volcanic activity. Culturally, economically, socially\n",
      "and technologically, fire was a revolutionary instrument – if we\n",
      "again remember that a prehistoric ‘revolution’ took millennia. It\n",
      "brought the possibility of warmth and light and therefore of a\n",
      "double extension of the habitable environment, into the cold and\n",
      "into the dark. In physical terms, one obvious expression of this was\n",
      "the occupation of caves. Animals could now be driven out and kept\n",
      "out by fire (and perhaps the seed lies here of the use of fire to drive\n",
      "big game in hunting). Technology could move forward: spears\n",
      "could be hardened in fires and cooking became possible,\n",
      "indigestible substances such as seeds becoming sources of food and\n",

      "Fire must have influenced mentality more directly, too. It was\n",
      "another factor strengthening the tendency to conscious inhibition\n",
      "and restraint, and therefore their evolutionary importance. The\n",
      "focus of the cooking fire as the source of light and warmth had also\n",
      "the deep psychological power which it still retains. Around the\n",
      "hearths after dark gathered a community almost certainly already\n",
      "aware of itself as a small and meaningful unit against a chaotic\n",
      "and unfriendly background. Language – of whose origins we as yet\n",
      "know nothing – would have been sharpened by a new kind of\n",
      "group intercourse. The group itself would be elaborated, too, in its\n",
      "structure. At some point, fire-bearers and fire specialists appeared,\n",
      "beings of awesome and mysterious importance, for on them\n",
      "depended life and death. They carried and guarded the great\n",
      "liberating tool, and the need to guard it must sometimes have\n",
      "made them masters. Yet the deepest tendency of this new power\n",
      "always ran towards the liberation of mankind. Fire began to break\n",
      "up the iron rigidity of night and day and even the discipline of the\n",
      "seasons. It thus carried further the breakdown of the great\n",
      "objective natural rhythms which bound our fireless ancestors.\n",
      "Behaviour could be less routine and automatic. There is even a\n",
      "discernible possibility of leisure.\n",
      "Big-game hunting was the other great achievement of Homo\n",
      "erectus. Its origins must lie far back in the scavenging which turned\n",
      "vegetarian hominids into omnivores. Meat-eating provided\n",
      "concentrated protein. It released meat-eaters from the incessant\n",
      "nibbling of so many vegetarian creatures, and so permitted\n",
      "economies of effort. It is one of the first signs that the capacity for\n",
      "conscious restraint is at work when food is being carried home to\n",
      "be shared tomorrow rather than consumed on the spot today. At\n",
      "the beginning of the archaeological record, an elephant and\n",
      "perhaps a few giraffes and buffaloes were among the beasts whose\n",
      "scavenged meat was consumed at Olduvai, but for a long time the\n",
      "bones of smaller animals vastly preponderate in the rubbish. By\n",
      "about 300,000 years ago the picture is wholly altered.\n",
      "This may be where we can find a clue to the way by which\n",

      "technique has to be transmitted and guarded, for the skills required\n",
      "to trap, kill and dismember the huge beasts of antiquity were\n",
      "enormous in relation to anything which preceded them. What is\n",
      "more, they were co-operative skills: only large numbers could carry\n",
      "out so complex an operation as the driving – perhaps by fire – of\n",
      "game to a killing-ground favourable because of bogs in which a\n",
      "weighty creature would flounder, or because of a precipice, well-\n",
      "placed vantage points, or secure platforms for the hunters. Few\n",
      "weapons were available to supplement natural traps and, once\n",
      "dead, the victims presented further problems. With only wood,\n",
      "stone and flint, they had to be cut up and removed to the home\n",

      "significance. Considered against a background of millions of years\n",
      "of evolution, the pace of change, though still unbelievably slow in\n",
      "terms of later societies, is quickening. These are not men as we\n",
      "know them, but they are beginning to be man-like creatures: the\n",
      "greatest of predators is beginning to stir in his cradle. Something\n",
      "like a true society, too, is dimly discernible, not merely in the\n",

      "experience was very great, for knowledge of methods which were\n",
      "likely to succeed rested upon it, not (as increasingly in modern\n",
      "society) on experiment and analysis. This fact alone would have\n",
      "given new importance to the older and more experienced. They\n",
      "knew how things were done and what methods worked and they\n",
      "did so at a time when the home base and big-game hunting made\n",
      "their maintenance by the group easier. They would not have been\n",
      "very old, of course. Very few can have lived more than forty years.\n",
      "Selection also favoured those groups whose members not only\n",
      "had good memories but the increasing power to reflect given by\n",
      "speech. We know very little about the prehistory of language.\n",
      "Modern types of language can only have appeared long after\n",
      "Homo erectus disappeared. Yet some sort of communication must\n",
      "have been used in big-game hunting, and all primates make\n",
      "meaningful signals. How early hominins communicated may never\n",
      "be known, but one plausible suggestion is that they began by\n",
      "breaking up calls akin to those of other animals into particular\n",
      "sounds capable of rearrangement. This would give the possibility\n",
      "of different messages and may be the remote tap-root of grammar.\n",
      "What is certain is that a great acceleration of evolution would\n",
      "follow the appearance of groups able to pool experience, to\n",
      "practise and refine skills, to elaborate ideas through language.\n",

       "'1\\nThe Foundations\\nThe roots of history lie in the pre-human past and it is hard (but\\nimportant) to grasp just how long ago that was. If we think of a\\ncentury on our calendar as a minute on some great clock recording\\nthe passage of time, then Europeans began to settle in the\\nAmericas only about five minutes ago. Slightly less than fifteen\\nminutes before that, Christianity appeared. Rather more than an\\nhour ago people settled in southern Mesopotamia who were soon\\nto evolve the oldest civilization known to us. This is already well\\nbeyond the furthest margin of written record; according to our\\nclock, people began writing down the past much less than an hour\\nago, too. Some six or seven hours further back on our scale, and\\nmuch more remote, we can discern the first recognizable human\\nbeings of a modern physiological type already established in\\nwestern Europe. Behind them, anything from a fortnight to three\\nweeks earlier, appear the first traces of creatures with some human\\ncharacteristics whose contribution to the evolution which followed\\nis still in debate.\\nHow much further back into a growing darkness we need go in\\norder to understand the origins of man is debatable, but it is worth\\nconsidering for a moment even larger tracts of time simply because\\nso much happened in them which, even if we cannot say anything\\nvery precise about it, shaped what followed. This is because\\nhumanity was to carry forward into historical times certain\\npossibilities and limitations, and they were settled long ago, in a\\npast even more remote than the much shorter period of time – 4½\\nmillion years or so – in which creatures with at least some claim to\\nhuman qualities are known to have existed. Though it is not our\\ndirect concern, we need to try to understand what was in the\\nbaggage of advantages and disadvantages with which human\\nbeings alone among the primates emerged after these huge tracts\\nof time as change-makers. Virtually all the physical and much of\\nthe mental formation we still take for granted was by then\\ndetermined, fixed in the sense that some possibilities were excluded\\nand others were not. The crucial process is the evolution of human\\ncreatures as a distinct branch among the primates, for it is at this\\nfork in the line, as it were, that we begin to look out for the station\\nat which we get off for History. It is here that we can hope to find\\nthe first signs of that positive, conscious impact upon environment\\nwhich marks the first stage of human achievement.\\nThe bedrock of the story is the earth itself. Changes recorded in\\nfossils of flora and fauna, in geographical forms and geological\\nstrata, narrate a drama of epic scale lasting hundreds of millions of\\nyears. During them the shape of the world changed out of\\nrecognition many times. Great rifts opened and closed in its\\nsurface, coasts rose and fell; at times huge areas were covered with\\na long-since vanished vegetation. Many species of plants and\\nanimals emerged and proliferated. Most died out. Yet these\\n‘dramatic’ events happened with almost unimaginable slowness.\\nSome lasted millions of years; even the most rapid took centuries.\\nThe creatures who lived while they were going on could no more\\nhave perceived them than a twenty-first-century butterfly, in its\\nthree weeks or so of life, could sense the rhythm of the seasons. Yet\\nslowly the earth was taking shape as a collection of habitats\\npermitting different strains to survive. Meanwhile, biological\\nevolution inched forwards with almost inconceivable slowness.\\nClimate was the first great pacemaker of change. About 65\\nmillion years ago – an early enough point at which to begin to\\ngrapple with our story – a long warm climatic phase began to\\ndraw to a close. It had favoured the great reptiles and during it\\nAntarctica had separated from Australia. There were no ice-fields\\nthen in any part of the globe. As the world grew colder and the\\nnew climatic conditions restricted their habitat, the great reptiles\\ndid not manage to adapt, though it is likely that it was a sudden\\nevent – the impact of a giant asteroid – that killed them off\\ncompletely. But the new conditions suited other animal strains\\nwhich were already about, among them some mammals whose tiny\\nancestors had appeared 200 million years or so earlier. They now\\ninherited the earth, or a considerable part of it. With many breaks\\nin sequence and accidents of selection on the way, these strains\\nwere themselves to evolve into the mammals which occupy our\\nown world – ourselves included.\\nCrudely summarized, the main lines of this evolution were\\nprobably determined for millions of years mainly by astronomical\\ncycles and a few sudden events, such as eruption of massive\\nvolcanoes or the impact of asteroids. Climate was the all-important\\nfactor, changed by the earth’s position in relation to the sun or by\\nshort-term circumstances. A huge pattern emerges, of recurrent\\nswings of temperature. The extremes which resulted, of climatic\\ncooling on the one hand and aridity on the other, choked off some\\npossible lines of development. Conversely, in other times, and in\\ncertain places, the onset of appropriately benign conditions\\nallowed certain species to flourish and encouraged their spread\\ninto new habitats. The only major sub-division of this immensely\\nlong process which concerns us comes very recently (in prehistoric\\nterms), slightly less than 4 million years ago. There then began a\\nperiod of climatic changes which we believe to have been more\\nrapid and violent than most observed in earlier times. ‘Rapid’, we\\nmust again remind ourselves, is a comparative term; these changes\\ntook tens of thousands of years. Such a pace of change, though,\\nlooks very different from the millions of years of much steadier\\nconditions which lay in the past.\\nScholars have long talked about ‘Ice Ages’, each lasting between\\n50,000 and 100,000 years, which covered big areas of the northern\\nhemisphere (including much of Europe, and America as far south\\nas modern New York) with great ice sheets, sometimes a mile or\\nmore thick. They have now distinguished some seventeen to\\nnineteen (there is argument about the exact number) such\\n‘glaciations’ since the onset of the first, over 3 million years ago.\\nWe live in a warm period following the most recent of them, which\\ncame to an end some 10,000 years ago. Evidence of these\\nglaciations and their effects is now available from all oceans and\\ncontinents and they provide the backbone for prehistoric\\nchronology. To the external scale which the Ice Ages provide we\\ncan relate such clues as we have to the evolution of humanity.\\nThe Ice Ages make it easy to see how climate determined life and\\nits evolution in prehistoric times, but to emphasize their dramatic\\ndirect effects is misleading. No doubt the slow onset of the ice was\\ndecisive and often disastrous for what lay in its path. Many of us\\nstill live in landscapes shaped by its scouring and gouging\\nthousands of centuries ago. The huge inundations which followed\\nthe retreat of the ice as it melted must also have been locally\\ncatastrophic, destroying the habitats of creatures which had\\nadapted to the challenge of arctic conditions. Yet they also created\\nnew opportunities. After each glaciation, new species spread into\\nthe areas uncovered by the thaw. Beyond regions directly affected,\\nthough, the effects of the glaciations may have been even more\\nimportant for the global story of evolution. Changes in\\nenvironment followed cooling and warming thousands of miles\\nfrom the ice itself; and the outcome had its own determining force.\\nBoth aridification and the spread of grassland, for instance,\\nchanged the possibilities of species spreading themselves into new\\nareas, especially if they could stand upright and move on two feet.\\nSome of those species form part of the human evolutionary story,\\nand all the most important stages in that evolution – so far\\nobserved – have been located in Africa, far from the ice-fields.\\nClimate can still be very important today, as contemplation of\\nthe disasters caused by drought show. But such effects, even when\\nthey affect millions of people, are not so fundamental as the slow\\ntransformation of the basic geography of the world and its supplies\\nof food which climate wrought in prehistoric times. Until very\\nrecently climate determined where and how humans lived. It made\\ntechnique very important (and still does): the possession in early\\ntimes of a skill such as fishing or fire-making could make new\\nenvironments available to branches of the human family fortunate\\nenough to possess such skills, or able to discover and learn them.\\nDifferent food-gathering possibilities in different habitats meant\\ndifferent chances of a varied diet and, eventually, of progressing\\nfrom gathering to hunting, and then to growing. Long before the\\nIce Ages, though, and even before the appearance of the creatures\\nfrom which humanity was to evolve, climate was setting the stage\\nfor and thus shaping, by selection, the eventual genetic inheritance\\nof humanity itself.\\nOne more backward glance is useful before plunging into the\\nstill shallow (though gradually deepening) pool of evidence. One\\nhundred million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two\\nmain sorts. Some, rodent-like, remained on the ground; others took\\nor had taken to the trees. In this way the competition for resources\\nwas lessened and strains of each survived to people the world with\\nthe creatures we know today. In the second group were the\\nprosimians. We are among their descendants, for they were the\\nancestors of the first primates.\\nIt is best not to be too impressed by talk about ‘ancestors’ in any\\nbut the most general sense. Between the prosimians and ourselves\\nlie millions of generations and many evolutionary blind alleys. It is\\nimportant none the less that our remotest identifiable ancestors\\nlived in trees because what survived in the next phase of evolution\\nwere genetic strains best suited to the special uncertainties and\\naccidental challenges of the forest. That environment put a\\npremium on the capacity to learn. Those survived whose genetic\\ninheritance could respond and adapt to the surprising, sudden\\ndanger of deep shade, confused visual patterns and treacherous\\nhandholds. Strains prone to accident in such conditions were wiped\\nout. Among those that prospered (genetically speaking) were some\\nspecies with long digits which were to develop into fingers and,\\neventually, the oppositional thumb, and other forerunners of the\\napes already embarked upon an evolution towards three-\\ndimensional vision and the diminution of the importance of the\\nsense of smell.\\nThe prosimians were little creatures. Tree-shrews still exist which\\ngive us some idea of what they were like; they were far from being\\nmonkeys, let alone men. Yet for millions of years they carried the\\ntraits which made humanity possible. During this time geography\\ncounted for much in their evolution, by imposing limits on contact\\nbetween different strains, sometimes effectively isolating them,\\nand thus increasing differentiation.\\nChanges would not happen quickly but it is likely that\\nfragmentations of the environment caused by geographical\\ndisturbance led to the isolation of zones in which, little by little,\\nthe recognizable ancestors of many modern mammals appeared.\\nAmong them are the first monkeys and apes. They do not seem to\\ngo back more than 60 million years or so.\\nThese monkeys and apes represent a great evolutionary stride.\\nBoth families had much greater manipulative dexterity than any\\npredecessor. Within them, species distinct in size or acrobatic\\nquality began to evolve. Physiological and psychological evolution\\nblur in such matters. Like the development of better and\\nstereoscopic vision, the growth of manipulative power seems to\\nimply a growth of consciousness. Perhaps some of these creatures\\ncould distinguish different colours. The brains of the first primates\\nwere already much more complex than those of any of their\\npredecessors; they were bigger, too. Somewhere the brain of one or\\nmore of these strains became complex enough and its physical\\npowers sufficiently developed for the animal to cross the line at\\nwhich the world as a mass of undifferentiated sensations becomes\\nat least in part a world of objects. Whenever this happened it was\\na decisive step towards mastering the world by using it, instead of\\nreacting automatically to it.\\nSome 25 or 30 million years ago, as desiccation began to reduce\\nthe area of the forests, competition for diminishing forest resources\\nbecame fiercer. Environmental challenge and opportunity\\nappeared where the trees and the grasslands met. Some primates,\\nnot powerful enough to hold on to their forest homes, were able,\\nbecause of some genetic quality, to penetrate the savannahs in\\nsearch of food and could meet the challenge and exploit the\\nopportunities. Probably they had a posture and movement\\nmarginally more like that of men than, say, that of the gorillas or\\nchimpanzees. An upright stance and the capacity to move easily on\\ntwo feet make it possible to carry burdens, among them food. The\\ndangerous open savannah could then be explored and its resources\\nwithdrawn from it to a safer home base. Most animals consume\\ntheir food where they find it; man does not. Freedom to use the\\nforelimbs for something other than locomotion or fighting also\\nsuggests other possibilities. We cannot confirm what the first ‘tool’\\nwas, but primates other than man have been seen to pick up\\nobjects which come to hand and wave them as a deterrent, use\\nthem as weapons, or investigate and expose possible sources of\\nfood with their aid.\\nThe next step in the argument is enormous, for it takes us to the\\nfirst glimpse of a member of the biological family to which both\\nman and the great apes belong. The evidence is fragmentary, but\\nsuggests that some 15 or 16 million years ago a very successful\\nspecies was widespread throughout Africa, Europe and Asia.\\nProbably it was a tree-dweller and certainly specimens were not\\nvery large – they may have weighed about forty pounds.\\nUnfortunately, the evidence is such as to leave it isolated in time.\\nWe have no direct knowledge of its immediate forebears or\\ndescendants, but some kind of fork in the road of primate\\nevolution seems to have occurred to its later relatives, often called\\nhominids, around 5 million years ago. While one branch was to\\nlead to the great apes and chimpanzees, the other led to human\\nbeings. This line has been named ‘hominin’. It is likely that the\\nseparation of these groups was a relatively slow process, occurring\\nover millions of years, with episodes of interbreeding taking place.\\nDuring that time big geological and geographical changes must\\nhave favoured and disfavoured many new evolutionary patterns.\\nThe earliest surviving hominin fossils belong to a species which\\nmay or may not provide the ancestors for the small hominids\\nwhich eventually emerged over a wide area of east and south-east\\nAfrica after this huge period of upheaval. They belong to the\\nfamily now called Australopithecus. The earliest fragments of their\\nfossils have been identified as over 4 million years old, but the\\noldest complete skull and a nearly complete skeleton found near\\nJohannesburg in 1998 are probably at least half-a-million years\\n‘younger’ than that. This is not very different (allowing for the\\ngenerous stretches of time and approximation available in\\nprehistoric chronology) from the dating of ‘Lucy’, formerly the\\nmost complete specimen of Australopithecus discovered (in\\nEthiopia). Evidence of other species of ‘australopithecines’ (as they\\nare usually termed), found as far apart as Kenya and the\\nTransvaal, can be dated to various periods over the next 2 million\\nyears and has had a great impact upon archaeological thinking.\\nSince 1970, something like 3 million years has been added to the\\nperiod in which the search for human origins goes on, thanks to\\nthe australopithecine discoveries. Great uncertainty and much\\ndebate still surround them, but if the human species have a\\ncommon ancestor it seems most likely that it belonged to a species\\nof this genus. It is with Australopithecus, though, and with what, for\\nwant of a better word, we must call its ‘contemporaries’ that the\\ndifficulties of distinguishing between apes, man-like apes and other\\ncreatures with some human characteristics first appear in their full\\ncomplexity. The questions raised are still becoming in some ways\\nmore difficult to deal with. No simple picture has yet emerged and\\ndiscoveries are still being made.\\nWe have most evidence about Australopithecus. But there came to\\nlive contemporaneously with some australopithecine species other,\\nmore man-like creatures, to whom the genus name Homo has been\\ngiven. Homo was no doubt related to Australopithecus, but is first\\nclearly identifiable as distinct about 2 million years ago on certain\\nAfrican sites; remains attributed to possible ancestors, however,\\nhave been dated by radioactivity to some 1½ million years before\\nthat.\\nWhere specialists disagree and may be expected to go on arguing\\nabout such fragmentary evidence as we have (all that is left of 2\\nmillion or so years of hominid life could be put on a big dining-\\ntable), laymen had better not dogmatize. Yet it is clear enough that\\nwe can be fairly certain about the extent to which some\\ncharacteristics later observable in humans already existed more\\nthan 2 million years ago. We know, for instance, that the\\naustralopithecines, though smaller than modern humans, had leg-\\nbones and feet which were man-like rather than ape-like. We know\\nthey walked upright and could run and carry loads for long\\ndistances as apes could not. Their hands showed a flattening at the\\nfingertips characteristic of those of men. These are stages far\\nadvanced on the road of human physique, even if the actual\\ndescent of our species is from some other branch of the hominid\\ntree.\\nIt is to early members of the genus Homo, none the less, that we\\nowe our first relics of tools. Tool-using is not confined to men, but\\nthe making of tools has long been thought of as a human\\ncharacteristic. It is a notable step in winning a livelihood from the\\nenvironment. Tools found in Ethiopia are the oldest which we have\\n(about 2½ million years old) and they consist of stones crudely\\nfashioned by striking flakes off pebbles to give them an edge. The\\npebbles seem often to have been carried purposefully and perhaps\\nselectively to the site where they were prepared. Conscious\\ncreation of implements had begun. Simple pebble choppers of the\\nsame type from later times turn up all over the Old World of\\nprehistory; about 1 million years ago, for example, they were in\\nuse in the Jordan valley. In Africa, therefore, begins the flow of\\nwhat was to prove the biggest single body of evidence about\\nprehistoric man and his precursors and the one which has provided\\nmost information about their distribution and cultures. A site at the\\nOlduvai Gorge in Tanzania has provided the traces of the first\\nidentified building, a windbreak of stones which has been dated\\n1.9 million years ago, as well as evidence that its inhabitants were\\nmeat-eaters, in the form of bones smashed to enable the marrow\\nand brains to be got at and eaten raw.\\nOlduvai prompts a tempting speculation. The bringing of stones\\nand meat to the site combines with other evidence to suggest that\\nthe children of early hominins could not easily cling to their\\nmother for long foraging expeditions as do the offspring of other\\nprimates. It may be that this is the first trace of the human\\ninstitution of the home base. Among primates, only humans have\\nthem: places where females and children normally stay while the\\nmales search for food to bring back to them. Such a base also\\nimplies the shady outlines of sexual differentiation in economic\\nroles. It might even register the achievement of some degree of\\nforethought and planning, in that food was not devoured to gratify\\nthe immediate appetite on the spot where it was taken, but\\nreserved for family consumption elsewhere. Whether hunting, as\\nopposed to scavenging from carcasses (now known to have been\\ndone by australopithecines), took place is another question, but the\\nmeat of large animals was consumed at a very early date at\\nOlduvai.\\nYet such exciting evidence only provides tiny and isolated\\nislands of hard fact. It cannot be presumed that the East African\\nsites were necessarily typical of those which sheltered and made\\npossible the emergence of humanity; we know about them only\\nbecause conditions there allowed the survival and subsequent\\ndiscovery of early hominin remains. Nor, though the evidence may\\nincline that way, can we be sure that any of these hominins is a\\ndirect ancestor of humanity; they may all be precursors. What can\\nbe said is that these creatures show remarkable evolutionary\\nefficiency in the creative manner we associate with human beings,\\nand suggest the uselessness of categories such as ape-men (or men-\\napes) – and that few scholars would now be prepared to say\\ncategorically that we are not directly descended from Homo habilis,\\nthe species first identified with tool-using.\\nIt is also easy to believe that the invention of the home base\\nmade biological survival easier. It would have made possible brief\\nperiods of rest and recovery from the hazards posed by sickness\\nand accident, thus sidestepping, however slightly, the process of\\nevolution by physical selection. Together with their other\\nadvantages, it may help to explain how examples of the genus\\nHomo were able to leave traces of themselves throughout most of\\nthe world outside the Americas and Australasia in the next million\\nor so years. But we do not know for certain whether this was\\nthrough the spread of one stock, or because similar creatures\\nevolved in different places. It is generally held, though, that tool-\\nmaking was carried to Asia and India (and perhaps to Europe) by\\nmigrants originally from East Africa. The establishment and\\nsurvival in so many different places of these hominins must show a\\nsuperior capacity to grapple with changing conditions, but in the\\nend we do not know what was the behavioural secret which\\nsuddenly (to continue to talk in terms of prehistoric time) released\\nthat capacity and enabled them to spread over the landmass of\\nAfrica and Asia. No other mammal settled so widely and\\nsuccessfully before our own branch of the human family, which\\nwas eventually to occupy every continent except Antarctica, a\\nunique biological achievement.\\nThe next clear stage in human evolution is nothing less than a\\nrevolution in physique. After a divergence between hominins and\\nmore ape-like creatures, which occurred around 5 million years\\nago, it took rather less than 2 million years for one successful\\nfamily of hominins to increase its brain size to about twice that of\\nAustralopithecus. One of the most important stages of this process,\\nand some of the most crucial in the evolution of humanity, were\\nalready reached in a species called Homo erectus. It was already\\nwidespread and successful a million years ago, and had by then\\nspread into Europe and Asia. The oldest specimen of the species so\\nfar found may be about half a million years older than that, while\\nthe last evidence for its survival (from Indonesia) suggests\\nmembers of it were still living between 10,000 and 15,000 years\\nago, well after our own kind had spread throughout most of the\\nearth. Homo erectus therefore successfully exploited a much bigger\\nenvironment than earlier species and did so for much longer than\\nhas Homo sapiens, our species of modern man. Many signs once\\nmore point to an African origin and thence to a spread through\\nEurope and Asia (where Homo erectus was first found). Apart from\\nfossils, a special tool helps to plot the distribution of the new\\nspecies by defining areas into which Homo erectus did not spread\\nas well as those into which he did. This is the so-called ‘hand-axe’\\nof stone, whose main use seems to have been for skinning and\\ncutting up large animals (its use as an axe in the usual, hafted\\nsense seems unlikely, but the name is established). There can be no\\ndoubt of the success of Homo erectus as a genetic product.\\nSub-species of Homo erectus survived for a very long time, and,\\nalthough few scholars now believe that any of these, at least in\\ntheir non-African form, is one of our direct ancestors, there is no\\nprecise dividing line between them and us (there never is in human\\nprehistory, a fact it is only too easy to overlook or forget). With\\nthe different sub-species of Homo erectus we are already dealing\\nwith a creature who has added to the upright stance of his\\npredecessors a brain approaching that of modern man in\\nmagnitude. Though we still know only a little of the way in which\\nthe brain is organized, there is, allowing for body size, a rough\\ncorrelation between size and intelligence. It is reasonable,\\ntherefore, to attribute great importance to the selection of strains\\nwith bigger brains and to reckon this a huge advance in the story\\nof the slow accumulation of human characteristics.\\nBigger brains meant bigger skulls and other changes too. An\\nincrease in antenatal size requires changes in the female pelvis to\\npermit the birth of offspring with larger heads, and another\\nconsequence was a longer period of growth after birth;\\nphysiological evolution in the female was not sufficient to provide\\nantenatal accommodation to any point approaching physical\\nmaturity. Human children need maternal care long after birth.\\nProlonged infancy and immaturity in their turn imply prolonged\\ndependency: it is a long time before such infants can gather their\\nown food. It may be with the early Homo erectus that there began\\nthat long extension of tolerated immaturity, whose latest\\nmanifestation is the maintenance of young people by society\\nduring long periods of higher education.\\nBiological change also meant that care and nurture came\\ngradually to count for more than large litters in ensuring the\\nsurvival of the species. This in turn implied further and sharper\\ndifferentiation in the roles of the sexes. Females were being pinned\\ndown much more by maternity at a time when food-gathering\\ntechniques seem to have become more elaborate and to demand\\narduous and prolonged co-operative action by males – perhaps\\nbecause bigger creatures needed more and better food.\\nPsychologically, too, the change may be significant. A new\\nemphasis on the individual is one concomitant of prolonged\\ninfancy. Perhaps it was intensified by a social situation in which\\nthe importance of learning and memory was becoming more and\\nmore profound and skills more complex. About this point the\\nmechanics of what is going forward begin to slip from our grasp\\n(if, indeed, they were ever in it). We are somewhere near the area\\nin which the genetic programming of the hominids is infringed by\\nlearning. This is the beginning of the great change from the\\nnatural physical endowment to tradition and culture – and\\neventually to conscious control – as evolutionary selectors, though\\nwe may never be able to say where precisely this change occurs.\\nAnother important physiological change is the loss of oestrus by\\nthe female hominin. We do not know when this happened, but\\nafter it had been completed her sexual rhythm was importantly\\ndifferentiated from that of other animals. Man is the only animal\\nin which the mechanism of the oestrus (the restriction of the\\nfemale’s sexual attractiveness and receptivity to the limited periods\\nin which she is on heat) has entirely disappeared. It is easy to see\\nthe evolutionary connection between this and the prolongation of\\ninfancy: if female hominins had undergone the violent disruption\\nof their ordinary routine which the oestrus imposes, their offspring\\nwould have been periodically exposed to a neglect which would\\nhave made their survival impossible. The selection of a genetic\\nstrain which dispensed with oestrus, therefore, was essential to the\\nsurvival of the species; such a strain must have been available,\\nthough the process in which it emerged may have taken a million\\nor a million and a half years because it cannot have been effected\\nconsciously.\\nSuch a change has radical implications. The increasing\\nattractiveness and receptivity of females to males make individual\\nchoice much more significant in mating. The selection of a partner\\nis less shaped by the rhythm of nature; we are at the start of a very\\nlong and obscure road which leads to the idea of sexual love.\\nTogether with prolonged infant dependency, the new possibilities\\nof individual selection point ahead also to the stable and enduring\\nfamily unit of father, mother and offspring, an institution unique\\nto mankind. Some have even speculated that incest taboos (which\\nare in practice well-nigh universal, however much the precise\\nidentification of the prohibited relationships may vary) originate\\nin the recognition of the dangers presented by socially immature\\nbut sexually adult young males for long periods in close association\\nwith females who are always potentially sexually receptive.\\nIn such matters it is best to be cautious. The evidence can take us\\nonly a very little way. Moreover, it is drawn from a very long span\\nof time, a huge period which would have given time for\\nconsiderable physical, psychological and technological evolution.\\nThe earliest forms of Homo erectus may not have been much like\\nthe last, some of whom have been classified by some scientists as\\narchaic forms of the next evolutionary stage of the hominin line.\\nYet all reflections support the general hypothesis that the changes\\nin hominins observable while Homo erectus occupies the centre of\\nour stage were especially important in defining the arcs within\\nwhich humanity was to evolve. He had unprecedented capacity to\\nmanipulate his environment, feeble though his handhold on it may\\nseem to us. Besides the hand-axes which make possible the\\nobservation of his cultural traditions, late forms of Homo erectus\\nleft behind the earliest surviving traces of constructed dwellings\\n(huts, sometimes fifty feet long, built of branches, with stone-slab\\nor skin floors), the earliest worked wood, the first wooden spear\\nand the earliest container, a wooden bowl. Creation on such a\\nscale hints strongly at a new level of mental ability, at a\\nconception of the object formed before manufacture is begun, and\\nperhaps an idea of process. Some have argued far more. In the\\nrepetition of simple forms, triangles, ellipses and ovals, in huge\\nnumbers of examples of stone tools, there has been discerned\\nintense care to produce regular shapes which does not seem\\nproportionate to any small gain in efficiency which may have been\\nachieved. Can there be discerned in this the first tiny budding of\\nthe aesthetic sense?\\nThe greatest of prehistoric technical and cultural advances was\\nmade when some of these creatures learnt how to manage fire.\\nUntil recently, the earliest available evidence of its use came from\\nChina, and probably from between 300,000 and 500,000 years\\nago. But very recent discoveries in the Transvaal have provided\\nevidence, convincing to some scholars, that hominins there were\\nusing fire well before that. It remains fairly certain that Homo\\nerectus never learnt how to make fire and that even his successors\\ndid not for a long time possess this skill. That he knew how to use\\nit, on the other hand, is indisputable. The importance of this\\nknowledge is attested by the folklore of many later peoples; in\\nalmost all of them a heroic figure or magical beast first seizes fire.\\nA violation of the supernatural order is implied: in the Greek\\nlegend Prometheus steals the fire of the gods. This is suggestive,\\nnot solid, but perhaps the first fire was taken from outbreaks of\\nnatural gas or volcanic activity. Culturally, economically, socially\\nand technologically, fire was a revolutionary instrument – if we\\nagain remember that a prehistoric ‘revolution’ took millennia. It\\nbrought the possibility of warmth and light and therefore of a\\ndouble extension of the habitable environment, into the cold and\\ninto the dark. In physical terms, one obvious expression of this was\\nthe occupation of caves. Animals could now be driven out and kept\\nout by fire (and perhaps the seed lies here of the use of fire to drive\\nbig game in hunting). Technology could move forward: spears\\ncould be hardened in fires and cooking became possible,\\nindigestible substances such as seeds becoming sources of food and\\ndistasteful or bitter plants edible. This must have stimulated\\nattention to the variety and availability of plant life; the science of\\nbotany was stirring without anyone knowing it.\\nFire must have influenced mentality more directly, too. It was\\nanother factor strengthening the tendency to conscious inhibition\\nand restraint, and therefore their evolutionary importance. The\\nfocus of the cooking fire as the source of light and warmth had also\\nthe deep psychological power which it still retains. Around the\\nhearths after dark gathered a community almost certainly already\\naware of itself as a small and meaningful unit against a chaotic\\nand unfriendly background. Language – of whose origins we as yet\\nknow nothing – would have been sharpened by a new kind of\\ngroup intercourse. The group itself would be elaborated, too, in its\\nstructure. At some point, fire-bearers and fire specialists appeared,\\nbeings of awesome and mysterious importance, for on them\\ndepended life and death. They carried and guarded the great\\nliberating tool, and the need to guard it must sometimes have\\nmade them masters. Yet the deepest tendency of this new power\\nalways ran towards the liberation of mankind. Fire began to break\\nup the iron rigidity of night and day and even the discipline of the\\nseasons. It thus carried further the breakdown of the great\\nobjective natural rhythms which bound our fireless ancestors.\\nBehaviour could be less routine and automatic. There is even a\\ndiscernible possibility of leisure.\\nBig-game hunting was the other great achievement of Homo\\nerectus. Its origins must lie far back in the scavenging which turned\\nvegetarian hominids into omnivores. Meat-eating provided\\nconcentrated protein. It released meat-eaters from the incessant\\nnibbling of so many vegetarian creatures, and so permitted\\neconomies of effort. It is one of the first signs that the capacity for\\nconscious restraint is at work when food is being carried home to\\nbe shared tomorrow rather than consumed on the spot today. At\\nthe beginning of the archaeological record, an elephant and\\nperhaps a few giraffes and buffaloes were among the beasts whose\\nscavenged meat was consumed at Olduvai, but for a long time the\\nbones of smaller animals vastly preponderate in the rubbish. By\\nabout 300,000 years ago the picture is wholly altered.\\nThis may be where we can find a clue to the way by which\\nAustralopithecus and his relatives were replaced by the bigger, more\\nefficient Homo erectus. A new food supply permits larger\\nconsumption but also imposes new environments: game has to be\\nfollowed if meat-eating becomes general. As the hominins become\\nmore or less parasitic upon other species there follows further\\nexploration of territory and new settlements, too, as sites\\nparticularly favoured by the mammoth or woolly rhinoceros are\\nidentified. Knowledge of such facts has to be learnt and passed on;\\ntechnique has to be transmitted and guarded, for the skills required\\nto trap, kill and dismember the huge beasts of antiquity were\\nenormous in relation to anything which preceded them. What is\\nmore, they were co-operative skills: only large numbers could carry\\nout so complex an operation as the driving – perhaps by fire – of\\ngame to a killing-ground favourable because of bogs in which a\\nweighty creature would flounder, or because of a precipice, well-\\nplaced vantage points, or secure platforms for the hunters. Few\\nweapons were available to supplement natural traps and, once\\ndead, the victims presented further problems. With only wood,\\nstone and flint, they had to be cut up and removed to the home\\nbase. Once carried home, the new supplies of meat mark another\\nstep towards the provision of leisure as the consumer is released\\nfor a time from the drudgery of ceaselessly rummaging in his\\nenvironment for small, but continuously available, quantities of\\nnourishment.\\nIt is very difficult not to feel that this is an epoch of crucial\\nsignificance. Considered against a background of millions of years\\nof evolution, the pace of change, though still unbelievably slow in\\nterms of later societies, is quickening. These are not men as we\\nknow them, but they are beginning to be man-like creatures: the\\ngreatest of predators is beginning to stir in his cradle. Something\\nlike a true society, too, is dimly discernible, not merely in the\\ncomplicated co-operative hunting enterprises, but in what this\\nimplies in passing on knowledge from generation to generation.\\nCulture and tradition are slowly taking over from genetic mutation\\nand natural selection as the primary sources of change among the\\nhominins. It is the groups with the best ‘memories’ of effective\\ntechniques which will carry forward evolution. The importance of\\nexperience was very great, for knowledge of methods which were\\nlikely to succeed rested upon it, not (as increasingly in modern\\nsociety) on experiment and analysis. This fact alone would have\\ngiven new importance to the older and more experienced. They\\nknew how things were done and what methods worked and they\\ndid so at a time when the home base and big-game hunting made\\ntheir maintenance by the group easier. They would not have been\\nvery old, of course. Very few can have lived more than forty years.\\nSelection also favoured those groups whose members not only\\nhad good memories but the increasing power to reflect given by\\nspeech. We know very little about the prehistory of language.\\nModern types of language can only have appeared long after\\nHomo erectus disappeared. Yet some sort of communication must\\nhave been used in big-game hunting, and all primates make\\nmeaningful signals. How early hominins communicated may never\\nbe known, but one plausible suggestion is that they began by\\nbreaking up calls akin to those of other animals into particular\\nsounds capable of rearrangement. This would give the possibility\\nof different messages and may be the remote tap-root of grammar.\\nWhat is certain is that a great acceleration of evolution would\\nfollow the appearance of groups able to pool experience, to\\npractise and refine skills, to elaborate ideas through language.\\nOnce more, we cannot separate one process from others: better\\nvision, an increased physical capacity to deal with the world as a\\nset of discrete objects, and the multiplication of artefacts by using\\ntools were all going on simultaneously over the hundreds of\\nthousands of years in which language was evolving. Together they\\ncontributed to a growing extension of mental capacity until one\\nday conceptualization became possible and abstract thought\\nappeared.\\nIt remains true, though, that if nothing very general can be\\nconfidently said about the behaviour of hominins before man, still\\nless can anything very precise be confirmed. We move in a fog,\\ndimly apprehending for a moment creatures now more, now less,\\nman-like and familiar. Their minds, we can be sure, are almost\\ninconceivably unlike our own as instruments for the registration of\\nthe outside world. Yet when we look at the range of the attributes\\nof Homo erectus it is his human, not pre-human, characteristics\\nwhich are most striking. Physically, he has a brain of an order of\\nmagnitude comparable to our own. He makes tools (and does so\\nwithin more than one technical tradition), builds shelters, takes\\nover natural refuges by exploiting fire, and sallies out of them to\\nhunt and gather his food. He does this in groups with a discipline\\nwhich can sustain complicated operations; he therefore has some\\nability to exchange ideas by speech. The basic biological units of\\nhis hunting groups probably prefigure the nuclear human family,\\nbeing founded on the institutions of the home base and a sexual\\ndifferentiation of activity. There may even be some complexity of\\nsocial organization in so far as fire-bearers and gatherers or old\\ncreatures whose memories made them the databanks of their\\n‘societies’ could be supported by the labour of others. There has to\\nbe some social organization to permit the sharing of co-operatively\\nobtained food, too. There is nothing to be usefully added to an\\naccount such as this by pretending to say where exactly can be\\nfound a prehistorical point or dividing line at which such things\\nhad come to be, but subsequent human history is unimaginable\\nwithout them. When an African relative of Homo erectus, perhaps\\npossessing slightly larger and more complex brains than others,\\nevolved into Homo sapiens it did so with an enormous achievement\\nand heritage already secure in its grasp. Whether we choose to call\\nit human or not hardly matters.\\n'"

      "challenge of arctic conditions. Yet they also created new opportunities. After\n",
      "each glaciation, new species spread into the areas uncovered by the thaw. Beyond\n",
      "regions directly affected, though, the effects of the glaciations may have been\n",
      "even more important for the global story of evolution. Changes in environment\n",
      "followed cooling and warming thousands of miles from the ice itself; and the\n",
      "outcome had its own determining force. Both aridification and the spread of\n",

      "Climate can still be very important today, as contemplation of the disasters\n",

      "branches of the human family fortunate enough to possess such skills, or able to\n",
      "discover and learn them. Different food-gathering possibilities in different\n",
      "habitats meant different chances of a varied diet and, eventually, of\n",
      "progressing from gathering to hunting, and then to growing. Long before the Ice\n",
      "Ages, though, and even before the appearance of the creatures from which\n",
      "humanity was to evolve, climate was setting the stage for and thus shaping, by\n",
      "selection, the eventual genetic inheritance of humanity itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "One more backward glance is useful before plunging into the still shallow\n",
      "(though gradually deepening) pool of evidence. One hundred million or so years\n",
      "ago, primitive mammals were of two main sorts. Some, rodent-like, remained on\n",
      "the ground; others took or had taken to the trees. In this way the competition\n",
      "for resources was lessened and strains of each survived to people the world with\n",
      "the creatures we know today. In the second group were the prosimians. We are\n",
      "among their descendants, for they were the ancestors of the first primates.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is best not to be too impressed by talk about ‘ancestors’ in any but the most\n",
      "general sense. Between the prosimians and ourselves lie millions of generations\n",
      "and many evolutionary blind alleys. It is important none the less that our\n",
      "remotest identifiable ancestors\n",
      "\n",
      "lived in trees because what survived in the next phase of evolution were genetic\n",
      "strains best suited to the special uncertainties and accidental challenges of\n",
      "the forest. That environment put a premium on the capacity to learn. Those\n",
      "survived whose genetic inheritance could respond and adapt to the surprising,\n",
      "sudden danger of deep shade, confused visual patterns and treacherous handholds.\n",
      "Strains prone to accident in such conditions were wiped out. Among those that\n",
      "prospered (genetically speaking) were some species with long digits which were\n",
      "to develop into fingers and, eventually, the oppositional thumb, and other\n",
      "forerunners of the apes already embarked upon an evolution towards three-\n",
      "dimensional vision and the diminution of the importance of the sense of smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prosimians were little creatures. Tree-shrews still exist which give us some\n",
      "idea of what they were like; they were far from being monkeys, let alone men.\n",
      "Yet for millions of years they carried the traits which made humanity possible.\n",
      "During this time geography counted for much in their evolution, by imposing\n",
      "limits on contact between different strains, sometimes effectively isolating\n",
      "them, and thus increasing differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes would not happen quickly but it is likely that fragmentations of the\n",
      "environment caused by geographical disturbance led to the isolation of zones in\n",
      "which, little by little, the recognizable ancestors of many modern mammals\n",
      "appeared. Among them are the first monkeys and apes. They do not seem to go back\n",
      "more than 60 million years or so.\n",
      "\n",
      "These monkeys and apes represent a great evolutionary stride. Both families had\n",
      "much greater manipulative dexterity than any predecessor. Within them, species\n",
      "distinct in size or acrobatic quality began to evolve. Physiological and\n",
      "psychological evolution blur in such matters. Like the development of better and\n",
      "stereoscopic vision, the growth of manipulative power seems to imply a growth of\n",
      "consciousness. Perhaps some of these creatures\n",
      "\n",
      "could distinguish different colours. The brains of the first primates were\n",
      "already much more complex than those of any of their predecessors; they were\n",
      "bigger, too. Somewhere the brain of one or more of these strains became complex\n",
      "enough and its physical powers sufficiently developed for the animal to cross\n",
      "the line at which the world as a mass of undifferentiated sensations becomes at\n",
      "least in part a world of objects. Whenever this happened it was a decisive step\n",
      "towards mastering the world by using it, instead of reacting automatically to\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some 25 or 30 million years ago, as desiccation began to reduce the area of the\n",
      "forests, competition for diminishing forest resources became fiercer.\n",
      "Environmental challenge and opportunity appeared where the trees and the\n",
      "grasslands met. Some primates, not powerful enough to hold on to their forest\n",
      "homes, were able, because of some genetic quality, to penetrate the savannahs in\n",
      "search of food and could meet the challenge and exploit the opportunities.\n",
      "Probably they had a posture and movement marginally more like that of men than,\n",
      "say, that of the gorillas or chimpanzees. An upright stance and the capacity to\n",
      "move easily on two feet make it possible to carry burdens, among them food. The\n",
      "dangerous open savannah could then be explored and its resources withdrawn from\n",
      "it to a safer home base. Most animals consume their food where they find it; man\n",
      "does not. Freedom to use the forelimbs for something other than locomotion or\n",
      "fighting also suggests other possibilities. We cannot confirm what the first\n",
      "‘tool’ was, but primates other than man have been seen to pick up objects which\n",
      "come to hand and wave them as a deterrent, use them as weapons, or investigate\n",
      "and expose possible sources of food with their aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step in the argument is enormous, for it takes us to the first glimpse\n",
      "of a member of the biological family to which both man and the great apes\n",
      "belong. The evidence is fragmentary, but suggests that some 15 or 16 million\n",
      "years ago a very successful\n",
      "\n",
      "species was widespread throughout Africa, Europe and Asia. Probably it was a\n",
      "tree-dweller and certainly specimens were not very large – they may have weighed\n",
      "about forty pounds. Unfortunately, the evidence is such as to leave it isolated\n",
      "in time. We have no direct knowledge of its immediate forebears or descendants,\n",
      "but some kind of fork in the road of primate evolution seems to have occurred to\n",
      "its later relatives, often called hominids, around 5 million years ago. While\n",
      "one branch was to lead to the great apes and chimpanzees, the other led to human\n",
      "beings. This line has been named ‘hominin’. It is likely that the separation of\n",
      "these groups was a relatively slow process, occurring over millions of years,\n",
      "with episodes of interbreeding taking place. During that time big geological and\n",
      "geographical changes must have favoured and disfavoured many new evolutionary\n",
      "patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest surviving hominin fossils belong to a species which may or may not\n",

      "belong to the family now called Australopithecus. The earliest fragments of\n",
      "their fossils have been identified as over 4 million years old, but the oldest\n",
      "complete skull and a nearly complete skeleton found near Johannesburg in 1998\n",
      "are probably at least half-a-million years ‘younger’ than that. This is not very\n",

      "Page 26:\n",
      "Changes would not happen quickly but it is likely that fragmentations of the\n",

      "family consumption elsewhere. Whether hunting, as opposed to scavenging from\n",

      "point to an African origin and thence to a spread through Europe and Asia (where\n",
      "Homo erectus was first found). Apart from fossils, a special tool helps to plot\n",
      "the distribution of the new species by defining areas into which Homo erectus\n",

      "fire well before that. It remains fairly certain that Homo erectus never learnt\n",
      "how to make fire and that even his successors did not for a long time possess\n",
      "this skill. That he knew how to use it, on the other hand, is indisputable. The\n",

      "Culturally, economically, socially and technologically, fire was a revolutionary\n",

It is tempting to reply ‘in the beginning’, but like many obvious answers, this soon turns out to be unhelpful. As a great Swiss historian once pointed out in another connection, history is the one subject where you cannot begin at the beginning. We can trace the chain of human descent back to the appearance of vertebrates, or even to the photosynthetic cells and other basic structures which lie at the start of life itself. We can go back further still, to the almost unimaginable upheavals which formed this planet and even to the origins of the universe. Yet this is not ‘history’.', embedding=None, page=19, paragraph_index=0, chapter_id='', book_id=''),\n",

We all know that dogs and cats do not have histories, while human beings do.

It is not quite as simple as that, though. First, we have to know what we are looking for, but most attempts to define humanity on the basis of observable characteristics prove in the end arbitrary and cramping, as long arguments about ‘ape-men’ and ‘missing links’ have shown. Physiological tests help us to classify data but do not identify what is or is not human. That is a matter of a definition about which disagreement is possible. Some people have suggested that human uniqueness lies in language, yet other primates possess vocal equipment similar to our own; when noises are made with it which are signals, at what point do they become speech? Another famous definition is that man is a tool-maker, but observation has cast doubt on our uniqueness in this respect, too, long after Dr Johnson scoffed at Boswell for quoting it to him.', embedding=None, page=19, paragraph_index=2, chapter_id='', book_id=''),\n",

That, of course, is its history. Humanity’s unique achievement is its remarkably intense level of activity and creativity, its cumulative capacity to create change. All animals have ways of living, some complex enough to be called cultures. Human culture alone is progressive; it has been increasingly built by conscious choice and selection within it as well as by accident and natural pressure, by the accumulation of a capital of experience and knowledge which man has exploited. Human history began when the inheritance of genetics and behaviour which had until then provided the only way of dominating the environment was first broken through by conscious choice. Of course, human beings have never been able to make their history except within limits. Those limits are now very wide indeed, but they were once so narrow that it is impossible to identify the first step which took human evolution away from the determination of nature. We have for a long time only a blurred story, obscure both because the evidence is fragmentary and because we cannot be sure exactly what we are looking for.', embedding=None, page=20, paragraph_index=3, chapter_id='', book_id='')]"
