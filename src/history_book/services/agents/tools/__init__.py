"""Tools for the LangGraph RAG agent.

This module contains tools that the agent can call to perform specific tasks:
- book_search: Search and retrieve information from the book
- web_search: Search external web sources for supplementary information

Tools are designed to be self-contained and produce complete outputs that the
agent can use directly or synthesize with other tool results.
